# Assignment 05: Low-Fidelity Prototype, Samantha Alexis Manuel, DH110


## Project Description

My project focuses on preserving family traditions through recipe and food connections. More specifically, this project explores the capabilities of a digital cookbook or archive that helps support users to engage with their family members through memory/shared interests in food despite limitations of time and space. 


### Purpose 

The purpose of creating and then testing this low-fidelity prototype is to reevaluate the usability of the new features that I suggested to add to this application. It also allows me to observe the user interact with the prototype in real-time while they communicate their thoughts aloud. I am mostly looking forward to the chance to learn if there are any potential solutions or features that I haven’t considered. 


### User Research 

My user research focuses on the users interested in food or looking to create more connections/conversations with their family. This is someone who really cares about food or loves to eat/cook. The user most likely comes from a family that places a lot of cultural value on cooking or eating/spending time together.

Here is more information on the [user research](https://github.com/samanthamanuel/DH110---Assignment03).


### Personas and Scenarios 

Through the guidance of my heuristic evaluation and user research, I created 2 personas that embody the user types that are most likely to create a digital food archive book/project. I also matched the personas with a feature they would most likely be interested in using. 

**Persona 1: Nayeli Castro** (Ability to add multiple collaborators to one project)

*Nayeli is a UCLA student who just recently moved into an apartment with 3 other students. She rarely cooks and feels incredibly homesick– feeling mostly disconnected from her family who is too busy to talk to her. She also struggles with cooking sustainable/fulfilling meals, but wants to learn how to cook new dishes while connecting with parents over home cooked meals. Being able to add multiple collaborators to an online project for sharing recipes would really solve her problem.*

**Persona 2: Alysha Macaraeg** (Ability to use a pre-existing template for recipe book page)

*Alysha is an established chef at a famous Filipino fusion restaurant. Hit with a sudden loss within her family, she feels an urgency to preserve her family’s recipes and histories. For her, that's through the process of documenting her family’s recipes. Many of her relatives live abroad and many of the recipes' instructions rely on oral traditions and intuition. If she had a template she could simply share online with all of her relatives, it would make it easier to templatize and organize recipes on a platform shared among family members.*

## Reflection 


Overall, the wireflow testing process went more smoothly that I expected. In fact, the individual I tested followed almost the exact same path that I outlined in the wire frame before (without any guidance). 

After going through the demo, I would make the function for creating a new project a lot clearer. Although they were able to find the right path to creating a new project, I realized that they were going through more steps needed to accomplish the task. In order to avoid this issue, I would incorporate a button for creating a new project on the landing page. As for the other tasks for the project, they were able to send/request for collaborators as well as fill the pre-existing template.

Some overall feedback that I received from the prototype testing was that they enjoyed the concept of the project as food is closely related to culture and family. They also thought, that overall, the app was very easy to use.
